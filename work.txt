- In this project, I use one accounting period last one month. In real world, one accounting period may last one month, one quarter, & one year
- At the end of the month, I need to do two things:
    +) Rendering a menu of remain warehouse management methods for user to choose, & a button represents that the current method
    should be kept until the end of last month
    +) Summarize all products quantity on hand according to product's import purchases & export orders
- Tempoprary questions:
    +) Does signal handler in Django acts like asynchronous or multi threading
    +) Between using normal function in views.py & signal handler, which one better & why?
    => Deciding to choose signal handler to handle the export shipment view & import shipment view (particularly assigning value for 
    product's quantity on hand field & product's current total value field). That is my task today
